<h2> Benelli</h2>
<ul> <li> The Benelli website is very nice in my opinion. It has a very clean professional feel to it. A large picture display at the top of the page has a carousel of a few of the featured gun models. There is limited literature and the use of inviting colors makes it an enjoyable site to be on. They have a ton of different pages to go to but it is in a nice format and it definitely is navigable and promotes easy use. The pictures are nice and show off some certain gun models with hunting backgrounds. I think that it fits the target market well. Benelli is a tasteful classy brand of high end shotgun I think the website reflects that. Grey white red and black are the main colors used on site, they are a nice mix and fit with the colors of the brand.
    
I like the Ranger Boats website because I think It it fits their target market very well, and it is appealing to me as someone who is in the market to buy a new boat. The website has a lot of open space in which they utilize a lot visuals (pictures of boats, and people fishing, visuals are very important when you are trying to buy a boat because you want to see the different models, features, colors, and see the boats in action. The open space gives the website a clean uncluttered open feel. The use of html5 elements are present. Navigation on the website is very easy, they have the right information on the website in a good layout. Again, if they were to try to cram too much information it would take away from the visuals and be less appealing to potential buyers. They utilize a carousel style format to cycle through different pictures, styles, and options to help with the clean uncluttered feel. It is easy to click through at a desired pace. They also have a scroll effect as you scroll down and also as you move your cursor across certain boxes pictures are illuminated keeping the attention on the one style you are looking at in the present. The site uses primarily charcoal and white colors along with some red which is in the Ranger logo. The darker colors help make the visuals pop, such as some pictures featuring sunsets, which are appealing and attractive from a consumer standpoint I think the site does a very good job at keeping words to a minimum, it helps draw more attention to the boat models. If someone sees something they like then they can click on it to read more about the boat. The charcoal and white color contrast is nice and I think it works well, again it doesn’t pop as much as white would on black which helps the visuals. It also isn't a super common color scheme, it’s kind of nice to see something different.
	
I did not like the Bureau of Labor Statistics website, This website is not clean at all, it is unbelievably cluttered and is overwhelming to look at. You don’t know where to begin or where to look. They have way to much content on the homepage compared to the Ranger site. They should have utilized more scroll space to at least help spread out the information a little bit. The side columns and everything make things less appealing. The lay out does not make a whole lot of sense. The main colors are red white and black. Red is used at the top and bottom of the site but it is primarily just black font on white space which is adding to the clutter feel and makes it harder to follow along and distinguish different things. The overall navigability is not very good due to how confusing the site is. There are way too many options to click on that take you to different places where you have to choose from another page full of options to click on.
