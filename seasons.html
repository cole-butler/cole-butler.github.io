    <p> For some, spring is a time to get out the fishing poles and search for quiet spots on the river to enjoy beautiful days in a peaceful setting. Summer is a time to pull the boat out of storage and enjoy surrounding lakes with family and friends, celebrating days like the 4th of July. Autumn is a time when hunters dust off their bows and spend time in the mountains connecting with nature and trying to provide food for their family friends for the upcoming winter. Winter is a time when these sportsman enjoy ice fishing, skiing, and reflecting on the amazing adventures they had over the past 9 months and begin planning next seasons adventures.</p>
    <p> Every year we experience seasons differently, just like the weather patterns are different each year our own patterns are also different. The change in seasons provides opportunities for everyone and they are times we look forward to. What will you be doing next season? or the season after that? Life is short so plan your trips now, and take on each new season with a plan!</p>
