          <h1>About Ranger Boats</h1>
           Celebrating its 50th Anniversary in 2018, the beginnings of Ranger Boats can be traced to 1968 with founders Forrest and Nina Wood. After building the original six boats in what is now the City Hall in downtown Flippin, Ark., the business grew quickly and soon became a household name among fishermen across the country. In the half-century since then, Ranger has pioneered many innovations that are now industry standards.</p>
